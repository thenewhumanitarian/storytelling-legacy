    Since then, the HTML5 working group has put a lot of thought into slimming down that minimal set of tags. It turns out all major browsers agree on several shortcuts that can cut down on the code, and the HTML5 specification now allows for these shortcuts to be used in valid code. Because all browsers (even old ones like IE6) fully support the shortcuts that are being standardized in HTML5, we can use them today; this is despite most new features of HTML5 remaining off-limits until the browsers catch up.
